#lazysizes
**lazysizes** is a fast (jank-free) and self-initializing lazyloader for images (including responsive images), iframes, scripts/widgets and much more. It may become also your number one tool to integrate responsive images. Due to the fact that it can also automatically calculate the ``sizes`` attribute for your responsive images based on your CSS as also allows to use custom labeled media queries for you ``media`` attributes, it helps to separate layout (CSS) from content/structure (HTML) and makes integrating responsive images into any environment simply simple.

##How to

1. Download the [lazysizes.min.js script](lazysizes.min.js) and include **lazysizes** in your webpage.

    ```html
    <script src="lazysizes.min.js" async=""></script>
    ```

2. lazysizes does not need any JS configuration: Add the ``class`` ``"lazyload"`` to your images/iframes in conjunction with a ``data-src`` or ``data-srcset`` attribute. Optionally you can also add a ``src`` attribute with a low quality image:

    ```html
    <!-- non-responsive: -->
    <img src="low-quality-src.jpg" data-src="normal-quality-src.jpg" class="lazyload" />
    ```
    ```html
    <!-- responsive example with automatic sizes calculation: -->
    <img
        data-sizes="auto"
        src="lqip-src.jpg"
        data-srcset="lqip-src.jpg 220w,
        image2.jpg 300w,
        image3.jpg 600w,
        image4.jpg 900w" class="lazyload" />
    ```
    ```html
    <!-- iframe example -->
    <iframe frameborder="0" 
    	class="lazyload" 
        allowfullscreen="" 
        data-src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ZfV-aYdU4uE">
    </iframe>
    ```

##What makes lazysizes so awesome:
**lazysizes** is different than other lazy image loaders.

1. **Works without any configuration or JS callbacks in any web enviroment**: The script works as an universal, self-initializing, self-configuring and self-destroying component and detects any changes to the visibility of any current and future image/iframe elements automatically no matter whether it becomes visible through a user scroll, a CSS animation triggered through ``:hover`` or through any kind of JS behavior (carousel, slider, infinite scroll, masonry, isotope/filtering/sorting, AJAX, SPAs...). Also works automatically in conjunction with any kind of JS-/CSS-/Frontend-Framework (jQuery mobile, Bootstrap, Backbone, Angular, React, ember).
2. **Future-proof**: It directly includes standard responsive image support (``picture`` and ``srcset``)
3. **Separation of concerns**: For responsive image support it adds an automatic ``sizes`` calculation as also alias names for media queries feature. There is also no JS change needed if you add a scrollable container with CSS (overflow: auto) or create a mega menu containing images.
4. **Performance**: It's based on high efficient and best practice code (runtime **and** memory) to work jank-free at 60fps. Can be used with thousands of images/iframes on CSS and JS heavy pages/webapps.
5. **Extendable**: It provides JS and CSS hooks to extend lazySizes with any kind of lazy loading, lazy instantiation, inview callbacks or effects (see also the [available plugins/snippets](#plugins)).
6. **Intelligent prefetch**: lazySizes prefetches near the view assets, only while the browser network is idling. (see also ``expand`` option)
7. **Lightweight, but mature solution**: lazySizes has the right balance between a lightweight and a reliable and fast solution

##About responsive image support (``picture`` and/or ``srcset``)
For full cross browser responsive image support you must either use a polyfill like [respimage](https://github.com/aFarkas/respimage) or [picturefill](https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill) or use the [responsive image on demand plugin](plugins/rias).

##More about the API
**lazysizes** comes with a simple markup and JS API. Normally you will only need to use the markup API.

###Markup API
Add the ``class`` ``lazyload`` to all ``img`` and ``iframe`` elements, which should be loaded lazy. Instead of a ``src`` or ``srcset`` attribute, use a ``data-src`` or ``data-srcset`` attribute:

```html
<img data-src="image.jpg" class="lazyload" />
<!-- retina optimized image: -->
<img data-srcset="responsive-image1.jpg 1x, responsive-image2.jpg 2x" class="lazyload" />
```

**lazysizes** supports setting the ``sizes`` attribute automatically corresponding to the current size of your image. To add support for this add the value ``auto`` to the ``data-sizes`` attribute:

```html
<img
	data-sizes="auto"
	data-srcset="responsive-image1.jpg 300w,
    responsive-image2.jpg 600w,
    responsive-image3.jpg 900w" class="lazyload" />
```

**Important: How ``sizes`` is calculated**: The automatic sizes calculation takes the width of the image. If it is below ``50`` (can be configured through the ``minSize`` option), lazySizes traverses up the DOM tree until it finds a parent which is over ``50`` and uses this number. Often the following general CSS rule might help: ``img[data-sizes="auto"] { display: block; }``. (see also [specifying image/iframe dimensions](#specify-dimensions)

##Recommended markup patterns
For some image bots (search engines and social networks), legacy browsers (IE8) or JS disabled browsers, it is important to serve a usable ``src`` attribute:

###LQIP
The LQIP pattern (low quality image placeholder). Simply add a low quality image as the ``src``:

```html
<!-- responsive example: -->
<img
	data-sizes="auto"
    src="lqip-src.jpg"
	data-srcset="lqip-src.jpg 220w,
    image2.jpg 300w,
    image3.jpg 600w,
    image4.jpg 900w" class="lazyload" />
    
<!-- or non-responsive: -->
<img src="lqip-src.jpg" data-src="image.jpg" class="lazyload" />
```

###Simple pattern

For non crucial or below the fold images or in case you want to save more initial image data the LQIP pattern can't be used (an extreme fuzzy image does neither work as a good enough first impression nor as a fallback), you do use client side rendering (no preload parser advantage) or you can't even generate a LQIP src, simply omit the ``src`` attribute  or add a data uri as fallback ``src``.

```html
<img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="
	class="lazyload"
	data-srcset="image.jpg 1x, image2.jpg 2x"
    alt="my image" />
```

Note: In case you are using the simple markup pattern, consider to set the ``preloadAfterLoad`` to ``true`` (for SEO) and to add unobtrusive unveil effects using the ``addClasses`` option ([demo](http://afarkas.github.io/lazysizes/no-src.html#examples)).

###The noscript pattern

In case disabled javascript is a concern you can combine the simple pattern with an image inside a ``noscript`` element.

```html
<style>
	.no-js img.lazyload {
    	display: none;
    }
</style>

<!-- noscript pattern -->
<noscript>
	<img src="image.jpg" />
</noscript>
<img src="grey.jpg" data-src="image.jpg" class="lazyload" />
```

###[data-expand] attribute
Normally lazySizes will expand the viewport area to lazy preload images/iframes which might become visible soon. This value can be adjusted using the ``expand`` option.

Additionally this general option can be overridden with the ``data-expand`` attribute for each element. Different than the general ``expand`` option the ``data-expand`` attribute also accepts negative values (All numbers but ``0`` are accepted!).

This becomes especially handy to add unveiling effects for teasers or other elements:


```html
<style>
.lazyload,
.lazyloading {
	opacity: 0;
}
.lazyloaded {
	opacity: 1;
	transition: opacity 300ms;
}
</style>

<div class="teaser lazyload" data-expand="-20">
    <img data-src="image.jpg" class="lazyload" />
    <h1>Teaser Title</h1>
    <p>...</p>
</div>
```

###JS API
**lazysizes** automatically detects new elements with the class ``lazyload`` so you won't need to call or configure anything in most situations.

####JS API - options
Options can be set by declaring a global configuration option object named ``lazySizesConfig``. This object must be defined before the lazysizes script. A basic example:

```js
window.lazySizesConfig = {
    lazyClass: 'postbone', // use .postbone instead of .lazyload
    // preload all lazy elements in a lazy loading queue after onload, if on desktop
    preloadAfterLoad: !(/mobi/i.test(navigator.userAgent))
};
```

Here the list of options:

* ``lazySizesConfig.lazyClass`` (default: ``"lazyload"``): Marker class for all elements which should be lazy loaded (There can be only one ``class``. In case you need to add some other element, without the defined class, simply add it per JS: ``$('.lazy-others').addClass('lazyload');``)
* ``lazySizesConfig.preloadAfterLoad`` (default: ``false``): Whether lazysizes should load all elements after the window onload event. Note: lazySizes will then still download those not-in-view images inside of a lazy queue, so that other downloads after onload are not blocked.) In case this option is ``false`` and not providing a suitable low quality image placeholder will hide below the fold images from google.
* ``lazySizesConfig.preloadClass`` (default: ``"lazypreload"``): Marker class for elements which should be lazy pre-loaded after onload. Those elements will be even preloaded, if the ``preloadAfterLoad`` option is set to ``false``. Note: This *class* can be also dynamically set (``$currentSlide.next().find('.lazyload').addClass('lazypreload');``).
* ``lazySizesConfig.addClasses`` (default: ``true``): Whether lazysizes should add loading and loaded classes. This can be used to add unveil effects or to apply new styles (background-image).
* ``lazySizesConfig.loadingClass`` (default: ``"lazyloading"``): If ``addClasses`` is set to ``true`` this ``class`` will be added to ``img`` element as soon as image loading starts. Can be used to add unveil effects.
* ``lazySizesConfig.loadedClass`` (default: ``"lazyloaded"``): If ``addClasses`` is set to ``true`` this ``class`` will be added to any element as soon as the image is loaded or the image comes into view. Can be used to add unveil effects or to apply styles.
* ``lazySizesConfig.expand`` (default: ``120``): The ``expand`` option expands the calculated visual viewport area in all directions, so that elements can be loaded before they are becoming visible. (Note: Reasonable values are between ``20`` and ``200``.) In case you have a lot of small images or you are using the LQIP pattern you can lower the value, in case you have larger images set it to a higher value. Also note, that lazySizes will dynamically shrink this value to ``0``, if the browser is currently downloading and expand it (by multiplying the ``expand`` option with ``3.5``) if the browser network is currently idling. This option can be overridden with the ``[data-expand]`` attribute.
* ``lazySizesConfig.minSize`` (default: ``50``): For ``data-sizes="auto"`` feature. The minimum size of an image that is used to calculate the ``sizes`` attribute. In case it is under ``minSize`` the script traverses up the DOM tree until it finds a parent that is over ``minSize``.
* ``lazySizesConfig.srcAttr`` (default: ``"data-src"``): The attribute, which should be transformed to ``src``.
* ``lazySizesConfig.srcset`` (default: ``"data-srcset"``): The attribute, which should be transformed to ``srcset``.
* ``lazySizesConfig.sizesAttr`` (default: ``"data-sizes"``): The attribute, which should be transformed to ``sizes``. Makes almost only sense with the value ``"auto"``. Otherwise the ``sizes`` attribute should be used directly.
* ``lazySizesConfig.customMedia`` (default: ``{}``): The ``customMedia`` option object is an alias map for different media queries. It can be used to separate/centralize your multiple specific media queries implementation (layout) from the ``source[media]`` attribute (content/structure) by creating labeled media queries. (See also the [custommedia extension](plugins/custommedia)).
```html
<script>
window.lazySizesConfig = window.lazySizesConfig || {};
window.lazySizesConfig.customMedia = {
    '--small': '(max-width: 480px)',
    '--medium': '(max-width: 700px)',
    '--large': '(max-width: 1400px)'
};
</script>


<picture>
	<!--[if IE 9]><audio><![endif]-->
	<source
		data-srcset="http://placehold.it/500x600/11e87f/fff"
		media="--small" />
	<source
		data-srcset="http://placehold.it/700x300"
		media="--medium" />
	<source
		data-srcset="http://placehold.it/1400x600/e8117f/fff"
		media="--large" />
	<!--[if IE 9]></audio><![endif]-->
	<img
		src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="
		class="lazyload"
		data-srcset="http://placehold.it/1800x900/117fe8/fff"
		alt="image with artdirection" />
</picture>
```

####JS API - events
**lazysizes** provides two events to modify or extend the behavior of **lazysizes**.

* ``lazybeforeunveil``: This event will be fired on each lazyload element right before of the "unveil" transformation. This event can be used to extend the unveil functionality. In case the event is ``defaultPrevented`` the default transformation action will be prevented (see also the [ls.unveilhooks.js plugin](plugins/unveilhooks/ls.unveilhooks.js)):
```js
//add simple support for background images:
document.addEventListener('lazybeforeunveil', function(e){
    var bg = e.target.getAttribute('data-bg');
    if(bg){
        e.target.style.backgroundImage = 'url(' + bg + ')';
        e.target.removeAttribute('data-bg');
    }
}, false);
```

The ``lazybeforeunveil`` event can also be used to add unveil effects using JS:

```html 
<style>
img.lazyload {
    opacity: 0;
}
</style>

<script>
window.lazySizesConfig = {
    expand: 40
};

$(document).on('lazybeforeunveil', (function(){
	var onLoad = function(e){
		$(e.target)
			.animate({opacity: 1})
			.off('load error', onLoad)
		;

	};
	return function(e){
		if(!e.isDefaultPrevented()){
			$(e.target)
				.filter('img')
					.on('load error', onLoad)
			;
		}
	};
})());
</script>
```

For CSS transition/animations or progress bars / spinners use the ``addClasses`` option. See also the [animate.html](http://afarkas.github.io/lazysizes/animate.html) and the [no-src.html](http://afarkas.github.io/lazysizes/no-src.html) examples:

```html 
<style>
.lazyload,
.lazyloading {
	opacity: 0;
}
.lazyloaded {
	opacity: 1;
	transition: opacity 300ms;
}

/* or add a progress loader gif instead || Note: you need to add a transparent gif/data uri */

/*
.lazyloading {
    opacity: 1;
	transition: opacity 300ms;
	background: #f7f7f7 url(loader.gif) no-repeat center;
}
*/
</style>

<script>
window.lazySizesConfig = {
	//,expand: 80 //default is 120
};
</script>

<img
    src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="
    data-src="image.jpg"
    class="lazyload" />

```

The ``lazybeforeunveil`` can also be used for lazy initialization and due to the fact that lazySizes also detects new elements in the DOM automatically also for auto- and self-initialization of UI widgets:

```html
<script>
document.addEventListener('lazybeforeunveil', function(e){
    $(e.target)
        .filter('.slider')
        .slider({
            sliderOption: true
        })
    ;
});

document.addEventListener('lazybeforeunveil', function(e){
    $(e.target)
        .filter('.chart')
        .chart({
            animate: true
        })
    ;
});
</script>

<div class="slider lazyload"></div>

<div class="chart lazyload" data-expand="-10"></div>
```

* ``lazybeforesizes``: This event will be fired on each element with the ``data-sizes="auto"`` attribute right before the calculated ``sizes`` attribute will be set. The ``event.details.width`` property is set to the calculated width of the element and can be changed to any number. In case the event is ``defaultPrevented`` the ``sizes`` attribute won't be set.

####JS API - methods
#####``lazySizes.loader.unveil(DOMNode)``

In case a developer wants to show an image even if it is not inside the viewport the ``lazySizes.loader.unveil(DOMNode)`` can be called:

```js
lazySizes.loader.unveil(imgElem);
```

#####``lazySizes.autoSizer.updateElems()``

In case one or more image elements with the attribute ``data-sizes="auto"`` have changed in size ``lazySizes.autoSizer.updateElems`` can be called (For example to implement element queries):

```js
lazySizes.autoSizer.updateElems();
```

##Browser Support
**lazysizes** supports at least the following browsers: IE9+, Firefox 21+, Chrome 27+, Safari 6.1+, iOS Safari 7.0+, Android 4.0+

##Contributing
Fixes, PRs and issues are always welcome, make sure to create a new branch from the **master** (not the gh-pages branch), validate against JShint and test in all browsers. In case of an API/documentation change make sure to also document it here in the readme.md.

##<a name="plugins"></a>Available plugins in this repo
It is recommended to concat all plugins together with lazySizes. In case you don't concat it is recommended to include the plugin scripts *before* the lazySizes main script.

###[RIaS plugin - (Responsive Images as a Service / Responsive image on demand)](plugins/rias)
The [RIaS plugin is a neat full responsive images solution](plugins/rias) without the need of any additional plugins/polyfills.

It enables lazySizes to generate the best suitable image source based on an URL pattern. It works with pre-build images (i.e. grunt-responsive-images) as also with any third party (ReSrc, Pixtulate, mobify, WURFL's Image Tailor ...) or self hosted restful responsive image service (responsive image on demand). It makes responsive images even more easier without any need for another third party script.

```html
<img
	data-src="image-service/w_{width}/image.jpg"
	data-sizes="auto"
	class="lazyload"
	alt="" />
```

In general the [RIaS plugin](plugins/rias) plugin combines the simplicity of the famous Imager.js solution with the future power of native responsive images implementations and the webcomponent-like working of lazySizes' ``.lazyload`` elements (self-initialization, self-configuration and self-destroying).

###[OPTIMUMX plugin](plugins/optimumx)
The ``srcset`` attribute with the *w* descriptor and ``sizes`` attribute automatically also includes high DPI images. But each image has a different optimal pixel density, which might be lower (for example 1.5x) than the pixel density of your device (2x or 3x). This information is unknown to the browser and therefore can't be optimized for. The [lazySizes optimumx extension](plugins/optimumx) gives you more control to trade between perceived quality vs. perceived performance.

###[unveilhooks plugin](plugins/unveilhooks)
The [unveilhooks plugin](plugins/unveilhooks) plugin enables lazySizes to lazyload background images, widgets/components/scripts, styles and video/audio elements.

###[include plugin](plugins/include)
The [include plugin](plugins/include) plugin enables lazySizes to lazyload content, styles or AMD modules either simply postboned or conditionally (for example matching certain media queries). This extension also heavily simplifies architecture of conditional, dynamically changing responsive behavior and has an extreme great scalability.

###[bgset plugin](plugins/bgset)
The bgset plugin allows lazyload multiple background images with different resolutions/sizes (responsive background images). In case you only need one image use the unveilhooks extension.

###[print plugin](plugins/print)
The [print plugin](plugins/print) plugin enables lazySizes to unveil all elements as soon as the user starts to print. (Or set ``lazySizesConfig.preloadAfterLoad`` to ``true``).

##Why lazysizes
In the past I often struggled using lazy image loaders, because the "main check function" is called repeatedly and with a high frequency. Which makes it hard to fulfill two purposes runtime and memory efficiency. And looking into the source code of most so called lazy loaders often also unveils lazy developers...

But in a world of responsive retina optimized images on the one hand and JS widgets like carousels or tabs (a lot of initially hidden images) on the other hand lazy loading images becomes more and more important. And therefore I created this project. And in fact **lazysizes** is different.

Due to the fact, that it is designed to be invoked with a high frequency and therefore works highly efficient, it was possible to hook into all kind of events as also add a mutationobserver and therefore this lazyloader works as a simple drop in solution, you simply write/render your markup and no matter whether it was added by AJAX or revealed by a JS or CSS animation it will be picked up by **layzsizes**.

```html
<!-- responsive example: -->
<img
	data-sizes="auto"
    src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="
	data-srcset="image2.jpg 300w,
    image3.jpg 600w,
    image4.jpg 900w" class="lazyload" />
    
<!-- or non-responsive: -->
<img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="
    data-src="image.jpg"
    class="lazyload" />
```

##<a name="specify-dimensions"></a>Tip: Specifying image dimensions (minimizing reflows and avoiding page jumps)
To minimize reflows, content jumping or unpredictable behavior with some other JS widgets (isotope, masonry, some sliders/carousels...) the width **and** the height of an image should be calculable by the browser before the image source itself is loaded. For "static" images this can done using either CSS or using the content attributes:

```html
<img
	src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="
    width="350"
    height="150"
	data-srcset="http://placehold.it/350x150 1x,
    http://placehold.it/700x300 2x" class="lazyload" />
```

For flexible responsive images the [CSS intrinsic ratio scaling technique](http://www.mademyday.de/css-height-equals-width-with-pure-css.html) should be used:

```html
<style>
.ratio-container {
    position: relative;
}
.ratio-container:after {
    content: '';
    display: block;
    height: 0;
    width: 100%;
    /* 16:9 = 56.25% = calc(9 / 16 * 100%) */
    padding-bottom: 42.86%;
    content: "";
}
.ratio-container > * {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
}
</style>

<div class="ratio-container">
    <img
        src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="
        data-sizes="auto"
        data-srcset="http://placehold.it/175x75 175w,
        http://placehold.it/350x150 350w,
        http://placehold.it/700x300 700w,
        http://placehold.it/1400x600 1400w" class="lazyload" />
</div>
```

In case the exact ratio of your image is unknown you can also vary the intrinsic ratio like this:

```html
<style>
.ratio-container {
    position: relative;
}
.ratio-container:after {
    content: '';
    display: block;
    height: 0;
    width: 100%;
    /* 16:9 = 56.25% = calc(9 / 16 * 100%) */
    padding-bottom: 56.25%;
    content: "";
}
.ratio-container > * {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
}

/* unknown ration variation */
.unknown-ratio-container > * {
    max-width: 100%;
    max-height: 100%;
    width: auto;
    height: auto;
}
</style>

<div class="ratio-container unknown-ratio-container">
    <img
        src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="
        data-src="http://placehold.it/350x150"
        class="lazyload" />
</div>
```

**Note**: In case you use the "unknown intrinsic ratio pattern" the ``data-sizes="auto"`` feature should not be used.

##Tip: Where/How to include lazySizes
While lazy loading is a great feature, it is important for users that crucial inview images are loaded as fast as possible. (Most users start to interact with a page after inview images are loaded.)

In case you normally combine all your scripts into one large script and add this to the bottom of your page. It can be better for perceived performance to generate two or sometimes three script packages.

One small package, which includes all scripts which have heavy influence on the content or the UI and another larger one which includes the normal behavior of the page.

This smaller script, which includes lazySizes can than be placed before the other script (even in the head) to load the crucial content as fast possible.
